  Flying in a commercial plane is an extremely safe way to travel. According to the Economist, the chances of your plane suffering an accident are about 1 in 5 million. The Harvard School of Public Health found in 2006 that the annual risk of dying in a plane crash was one in 11 million, and aircraft safety only gets better every year. Despite this, Many people report feeling nervous when flying, and merely knowing the statistics may not be enough.  Human brains have trouble grasping such large numbers.  
  This program allows the user to interact with a probability calculator and simulate a flight as many times as they want by typing "Take a flight". Users can also let the program similate many flights automatically and the outcome "safe flight"  or "crash" are displayed on the screen.  Interacting in such a way may allow some users to gain a better understanding and appreciation of modern aircraft safety.
